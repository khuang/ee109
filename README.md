# EE109 Final Project Proposal

## Introduction

For our project, we will be accelerating the K Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm. We will be using a dataset on iris plants with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We will then use these features to characterize the class of the Iris in one of three classes(Iris SEtosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica).

## Literature Survey

## Project Description

## Measure

We will be measuring the quality of our design through multiple metrics. Primarily, we will be looking at raw performance through cycle counts. However, to have a more nuanced measurement, we will also look at resource utilization and make sure that we are using resources effectively (and not underutilizing resources). By considering both measurements, we will have a more robust idea of our design's performance.

## Planning

1. Software Simulation (Milestone 1 due May 18)
    * We are planning to complete the software simulation for this project by the first project milestone of May 18. For the software simulation, we are planning to implement KNN and play around to determinethe best distance function and the value of k to use for our project.
2. Hardware Simulation (Milestone 2 due May 27)
    * We will complete the initial hardware simulation by the milestone date of May 27. This will primarily be our first stage of hardware implementation and will optimize this implementation for performance in the next stage of the project.
3. Hardware Deployment (Milestone 3 due June 8)
    * Since we will not be able to deploy our project on hardware this quarter, for this milestone we will focus on improving our design's performance.
4. Report on Findings (Final Report due June 10)
